* Introduction                                                          :ignore:
In this document is explained how the Stewart Platform architecture is defined.

Some efforts has been made such that the procedure for the definition of the Stewart Platform architecture is as logical and clear as possible.

When possible, the notations are compatible with the one used in cite:taghirad13_paral.

The definition of the Stewart platform is done in three main parts:
- First, the geometry if defined (Section [[sec:definition_geometry]])
- Then, the inertia of the mechanical elements are defined (Section [[sec:definition_inertia]])
- Finally, the Stiffness and Damping characteristics of the elements are defined (Section [[sec:definition_dynamics]])

In section [[sec:summary_initialization]], the procedure the initialize the Stewart platform is summarize and the associated Matlab code is shown.

Finally, all the Matlab function used to initialize the Stewart platform are described in section [[sec:functions]].

* Definition of the Stewart Platform Geometry
<<sec:definition_geometry>>
** Introduction                                                      :ignore:
Stewart platforms are generated in multiple steps:
- Definition of the frames
- Definition of the location of the joints
- Computation of the length and orientation of the struts
- Choice of the rest position of the mobile platform

This steps are detailed below.

** Frames Definition
We define 4 important *frames* (see Figure [[fig:frame_definition]]):
- $\{F\}$: Frame fixed to the *Fixed* base and located at the center of its bottom surface.
  This is used to fix the Stewart platform to some support.
- $\{M\}$: Frame fixed to the *Moving* platform and located at the center of its top surface.
  This is used to place things on top of the Stewart platform.
- $\{A\}$: Frame fixed to the fixed base.
- $\{B\}$: Frame fixed to the moving platform.

Even though frames $\{A\}$ and $\{B\}$ don't usually correspond to physical elements, they are of primary importance.
Firstly, they are used for the definition of the motion of the Mobile platform with respect to the fixed frame:
- In position: ${}^A\bm{P}_{B}$ (read: Position of frame $\{B\}$ expressed in frame $\{A\}$)
- In rotation: ${}^A\bm{R}_{B}$ (read: The rotation matrix that express the orientation of frame $\{B\}$ expressed in frame $\{A\}$)
The frames $\{A\}$ and $\{B\}$ are used for all the kinematic analysis (Jacobian, Stiffness matrix, ...).

Typical choice of $\{A\}$ and $\{B\}$ are:
- Center of mass of the payload
- Location where external forces are applied to the mobile platform (for instance when the mobile platform is in contact with a stiff environment)
- Center of the cube for the cubic configuration

The definition of the frames is done with the =initializeFramesPositions= function ([[sec:initializeFramesPositions][link]]);

#+name: fig:frame_definition
#+caption: Definition of the Frames for the Stewart Platform
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[file:figs/frame_definition.png]]

** Location of the Spherical Joints
Then, we define the *location of the spherical joints* (see Figure [[fig:joint_location]]):
- $\bm{a}_{i}$ are the position of the spherical joints fixed to the fixed base
- $\bm{b}_{i}$ are the position of the spherical joints fixed to the moving platform

The location of the joints will define the Geometry of the Stewart platform.
Many characteristics of the platform depend on the location of the joints.

The location of the joints can be set to arbitrary positions or it can be computed to obtain specific configurations such as:
- A cubic configuration: function =generateCubicConfiguration= (described in [[file:cubic-configuration.org][this]] file)
- A symmetrical configuration

A function (=generateGeneralConfiguration=) to set the position of the joints on a circle is described [[sec:generateGeneralConfiguration][here]].

The location of the spherical joints are then given by ${}^{F}\bm{a}_{i}$ and ${}^{M}\bm{b}_{i}$.

#+name: fig:joint_location
#+caption: Position of the Spherical/Universal joints for the Stewart Platform
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[file:figs/joint_location.png]]

** Length and orientation of the struts
From the location of the joints (${}^{F}\bm{a}_{i}$ and ${}^{M}\bm{b}_{i}$), we compute the length $l_i$ and orientation of each strut $\hat{\bm{s}}_i$ (unit vector aligned with the strut).
The length and orientation of each strut is represented in figure [[fig:length_orientation_struts]].

This is done with the =computeJointsPose= function ([[sec:computeJointsPose][link]]).

#+name: fig:length_orientation_struts
#+caption: Length $l_i$ and orientation $\hat{\bm{s}}_i$ of the Stewart platform struts
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[file:figs/length_orientation_struts.png]]

** Rest Position of the Stewart platform
We may want to initialize the Stewart platform in some position and orientation that corresponds to its rest position.

To do so, we choose:
- the position of $\bm{O}_B$ expressed in $\{A\}$ using ${}^A\bm{P}$
- the orientation of $\{B\}$ expressed in $\{A\}$ using a rotation matrix ${}^{A}\bm{R}_{B}$

Then, the function =initializeStewartPose= ([[sec:initializeStewartPose][link]]) compute the corresponding initial and rest position of each of the strut.

* Definition of the Inertia and geometry of the Fixed base, Mobile platform and Struts
<<sec:definition_inertia>>
** Introduction                                                      :ignore:
Now that the geometry of the Stewart platform has been defined, we have to choose the inertia of:
- The Fixed base
- The Mobile platform
- The two parts of the struts

The inertia of these elements will modify the dynamics of the systems.
It is thus important to set them properly.

** Inertia and Geometry of the Fixed and Mobile platforms
In order to set the inertia of the fixed and mobile platforms, we can use the following function that assume that both platforms are cylindrical:
- =initializeCylindricalPlatforms= ([[sec:initializeCylindricalPlatforms][link]]): by choosing the height, radius and mass of the platforms, it computes the inertia matrix that will be used for simulation

** Inertia and Geometry of the struts
Similarly for the struts, we suppose here that they have a cylindrical shape.
They are initialize with the following function:
- =initializeCylindricalStruts= ([[sec:initializeCylindricalStruts][link]]): the two parts of each strut are supposed to by cylindrical. We can set the mass and geometry of both strut parts.

* Definition of the stiffness and damping of the joints
<<sec:definition_dynamics>>

** Introduction                                                      :ignore:
The global stiffness and damping of the Stewart platform depends on its geometry but also on the stiffness and damping of:
- the actuator because of the finite stiffness of the actuator / linear guide
- the spherical joints

** Stiffness and Damping of the Actuator
Each Actuator is modeled by 3 elements in parallel (Figure [[fig:stewart_platform_actuator]]):
- A spring with a stiffness $k_{i}$
- A dashpot with a damping $c_{i}$
- An ideal force actuator generating a force $\tau_i$

#+name: fig:stewart_platform_actuator
#+caption: Model of the Stewart platform actuator
[[file:figs/stewart_platform_actuator.png]]

The initialization of the stiffness and damping properties of the actuators is done with the =initializeStrutDynamics= ([[sec:initializeStrutDynamics][link]]).

** Stiffness and Damping of the Spherical Joints
Even though we often suppose that the spherical joint are perfect in the sense that we neglect its stiffness and damping, we can set some rotation stiffness and damping of each of the spherical/universal joints.

This is done with the =initializeJointDynamics= function ([[sec:initializeJointDynamics][link]]).

* Summary of the Initialization Procedure and Matlab Example
<<sec:summary_initialization>>
** Introduction                                                      :ignore:
The procedure to define the Stewart platform is the following:
1. Define the initial position of frames $\{A\}$, $\{B\}$, $\{F\}$ and $\{M\}$.
   We do that using the =initializeFramesPositions= function.
   We have to specify the total height of the Stewart platform $H$ and the position ${}^{M}\bm{O}_{B}$ of $\{B\}$ with respect to $\{M\}$.
2. Compute the positions of joints ${}^{F}\bm{a}_{i}$ and ${}^{M}\bm{b}_{i}$.
   We can do that using various methods depending on the wanted architecture:
   - =generateCubicConfiguration= permits to generate a cubic configuration
3. Compute the position and orientation of the joints with respect to the fixed base and the moving platform.
   This is done with the =computeJointsPose= function.
   If wanted, compute the rest position of each strut to have the wanted pose of the mobile platform with the function =initializeStewartPose=.
4. Define the mass and inertia of each element of the Stewart platform with the =initializeCylindricalPlatforms= and =initializeCylindricalStruts=
5. Define the dynamical properties of the Stewart platform by setting the stiffness and damping of the actuators and joints.

By following this procedure, we obtain a Matlab structure =stewart= that contains all the information for the Simscape model and for further analysis.

** Matlab Init                                              :noexport:ignore:

  <<matlab-init>>
#+end_src

#+begin_src matlab

** Example of the initialization of a Stewart Platform
Let's first define the Stewart Platform Geometry.
#+begin_src matlab
  stewart = initializeFramesPositions('H', 90e-3, 'MO_B', 45e-3);
  stewart = generateGeneralConfiguration(stewart);
  stewart = computeJointsPose(stewart);
  stewart = initializeStewartPose(stewart, 'AP', [0;0;0.01], 'ARB', eye(3));
#+end_src

Then, define the inertia and geometry of the fixed base, mobile platform and struts.
#+begin_src matlab
  stewart = initializeCylindricalPlatforms(stewart);
  stewart = initializeCylindricalStruts(stewart);
#+end_src

Finally, initialize the strut stiffness and damping properties.
#+begin_src matlab
  stewart = initializeStrutDynamics(stewart, 'Ki', 1e6*ones(6,1), 'Ci', 1e2*ones(6,1));
  stewart = initializeJointDynamics(stewart);
#+end_src

The obtained =stewart= Matlab structure contains all the information for analysis of the Stewart platform and for simulations using Simscape.

The function =displayArchitecture= can be used to display the current Stewart configuration:
#+begin_src matlab
  displayArchitecture(stewart);
#+end_src

#+header: :tangle no :exports results :results none :noweb yes
#+begin_src matlab :var filepath="figs/stewart_architecture_example.pdf" :var figsize="wide-tall" :post pdf2svg(file=*this*, ext="png")

#+caption: Display of the current Stewart platform architecture ([[./figs/stewart_architecture_example.png][png]], [[./figs/stewart_architecture_example.pdf][pdf]])
[[file:figs/stewart_architecture_example.png]]

There are many options to show or hides elements such as labels and frames.
The documentation of the function is available [[sec:displayArchitecture][here]].

Let's now move a little bit the top platform and re-display the configuration:
#+begin_src matlab
  tx = 0.1; % [rad]
  ty = 0.2; % [rad]
  tz = 0.05; % [rad]

  Rx = [1 0        0;
        0 cos(tx) -sin(tx);
        0 sin(tx)  cos(tx)];

  Ry = [ cos(ty) 0 sin(ty);
        0        1 0;
        -sin(ty) 0 cos(ty)];

  Rz = [cos(tz) -sin(tz) 0;
        sin(tz)  cos(tz) 0;
        0        0       1];

  ARB = Rz*Ry*Rx;
  AP = [0.08; 0; 0]; % [m]

  displayArchitecture(stewart, 'AP', AP, 'ARB', ARB);
  view([0 -1 0]);
